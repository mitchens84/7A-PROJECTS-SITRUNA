## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with Content Structure**: The content schema and relationship implementation should be prioritized as it affects many other components.

2. **Performance Optimization**: Focus on quick wins like code splitting and caching before moving to more complex optimizations.

3. **Iterative Testing**: Test each enhancement as it's implemented rather than waiting until the end.

4. **Documentation First Approach**: Update documentation as you implement new features to keep it current.

5. **Accessibility Throughout**: Consider accessibility requirements from the beginning rather than as an afterthought.
