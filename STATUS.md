# Project Status Report

## Current Stack (as of 2025-05-15)

- **Framework**: React + TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Content Integration**: Auto-generated registry from module configuration files
- **Authentication**: Client-side password protection with localStorage persistence
- **UI Components**: Responsive Collapsible TOC with category grouping

## Completed Implementation

- Modern React application shell with Vite and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS integration for styling
- Dynamic content loading system with support for:
  - React components (lazy-loaded)
  - HTML pages (via iframe)
- Collapsible navigation UI with automatic content module registration
- Content registry generator script
- Simple example module via iframe integration
- Fixed CommonJS/ES Modules conflicts by adopting `.cjs` extension for PostCSS and Tailwind configs
- Fixed issues with Tailwind CSS by downgrading to v3.3.5 from v4 (resolving PostCSS plugin compatibility)
- Implemented client-side password protection with localStorage persistence
- Added logout functionality for secure session management
- Enhanced table of contents with category grouping and improved accessibility

## Recent Fixes and Improvements

- **Module System Compatibility**: Addressed CommonJS/ES Modules conflicts by correctly using `.cjs` for configuration files
- **PostCSS Configuration**: Resolved Tailwind CSS compatibility issues by using proper plugin configuration
- **Documentation**: Enhanced README with comprehensive guidance on:
  - Working with data in content modules
  - Storage options for preserving state
  - Troubleshooting common issues
- **Airtable Integration**: Added documentation for using the Airtable workflow extractor to generate data for content modules
- **Authentication**: Added simple client-side password protection for restricting access with logout functionality
- **Build System Fixes**: Resolved persistent issues with the Vite development server caching by implementing a standalone solution
- **UI/UX Improvements**: 
  - Added collapsible, responsive table of contents
  - Implemented category grouping view for better organization
  - Enhanced overall accessibility with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

## Architectural Improvements

The refactored application addresses several pain points from the previous implementation:

1. **Simplified Content Addition**: Adding new content modules is now declarative via `module.config.ts`
2. **Reduced Refactoring Needs**: Content registry is auto-generated, eliminating manual imports/exports
3. **Flexible Content Types**: Support for both React components and HTML content
4. **Better Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration
5. **Modern Development Experience**: Hot module reloading, fast builds
6. **Basic Access Control**: Simple authentication to restrict unauthorized access
7. **Improved UI/UX**: Collapsible navigation, category grouping, and enhanced accessibility
8. **Deployment Support**: GitHub Pages deployment configuration

## Next Steps

1. **User Preferences Storage**: Add persistent user preferences using localStorage
2. **Search Functionality**: Implement content search across modules
3. **Offline Support**: Add service worker for offline capability
4. **Data Visualization**: Create reusable chart components for dashboards
5. **Analytics**: Add basic usage tracking
