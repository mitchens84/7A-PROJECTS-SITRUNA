- Implemented client-side password protection with localStorage persistence
- Added logout functionality for secure session management
- Enhanced table of contents with category grouping and improved accessibility
- Fixed UI clash between logout button and table of contents
- Added Sitruna Knowledge Map module with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Added AI Workflow Proposal V2 module with category organization
- Deployed to GitHub Pages with proper base path configuration

## Architectural Improvements

The refactored application addresses several pain points from the previous implementation:

1. **Simplified Content Addition**: Adding new content modules is now declarative via `module.config.ts`
2. **Reduced Refactoring Needs**: Content registry is auto-generated, eliminating manual imports/exports
3. **Flexible Content Types**: Support for both React components and HTML content
4. **Better Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration
5. **Modern Development Experience**: Hot module reloading, fast builds
6. **Basic Access Control**: Simple authentication to restrict unauthorized access
7. **Improved UI/UX**: Collapsible navigation, category grouping, and enhanced accessibility
8. **Deployment Support**: GitHub Pages deployment configuration

## Next Steps

1. **User Preferences Storage**: Add persistent user preferences using localStorage
2. **Search Functionality**: Implement content search across modules
3. **Offline Support**: Add service worker for offline capability
4. **Data Visualization**: Create reusable chart components for dashboards
5. **Analytics**: Add basic usage tracking
