## II. Pending User Actions

### 1. Static Content Population
- [ ] Replace placeholder content in `/Users/mitchens/Local/PAGES/7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA/EXPRESS/example-static-site/index.html` with actual static content.
- [ ] Add any other static sites to the `/Users/mitchens/Local/PAGES/7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA/EXPRESS/` directory as needed.
- [ ] Update paths and titles in `/Users/mitchens/Local/PAGES/7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA/toc-static-data.json` to accurately reflect all static content.

### 2. Local Testing
- [ ] Run the application locally (`npm run dev` in `/Users/mitchens/Local/PAGES/7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA/`).
- [ ] Thoroughly test all features:
    - [ ] Authentication flow (login with "7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA", logout, access to protected routes).
    - [ ] ToC navigation for both React routes and static content links.
    - [ ] Persistence of ToC expanded sections (`localStorage`).
    - [ ] `AIWorkflowProposalPage` display and functionality.
    - [ ] Overall styling and application behavior across different screen sizes.

### 3. GitHub Repository & Deployment
- [ ] Initialize a Git repository in `/Users/mitchens/Local/PAGES/7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA/` (if not already done).
- [ ] Add the remote origin for the newly created `7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA` repository:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/mitchens84/7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA.git
    ```
- [ ] Commit all project files for `7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA`.
- [ ] Push the `main` branch to GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```
- [ ] **Build the project for deployment:**
    - Run `npm run build` inside `/Users/mitchens/Local/PAGES/7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA/`. This will generate a `dist` folder.
- [ ] **Prepare files for GitHub Pages:**
    - Create a `docs` folder at the root of your local `7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA` repository: `/Users/mitchens/Local/PAGES/7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA/docs/`.
    - Copy the *contents* of `/Users/mitchens/Local/PAGES/7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA/dist/` into `/Users/mitchens/Local/PAGES/7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA/docs/`.
    - Add and commit the `docs` folder and its contents. Push to GitHub.
- [ ] **Configure GitHub Pages:**
    - In your `7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA` repository settings on GitHub, go to the "Pages" section.
    - Under "Build and deployment", select "Deploy from a branch".
    - Choose the `main` branch and the `/docs` folder as the source.
    - Save the configuration.
- [ ] **Test Deployed Site:**
    - Access the site at `https://mitchens84.github.io/7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA/`. (Note: The `PAGES` segment is removed from the URL as it's its own repository).
    - Verify all functionality.
    - **Important:** Ensure `VITE_APP_BASE_URL` in your `.env.local` (and any production .env file) is set to `'/7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA/'` and the `base` in `vite.config.ts` is also `'/7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA/'`. Rebuild if you change these.


### 4. Project Brief Finalization
- [ ] Review and update `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` in `/Users/mitchens/Local/PAGES/7A-PROJECTS-SITRUNA/` with any final details, especially:
    - Primary Contact/Owner
    - Target Audience
    - Color Scheme, Fonts, Logo (if applicable)
    - Airtable integration details (if planned for this specific project)
